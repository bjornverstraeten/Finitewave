Tracking Activation Time in 2D Cardiac Tissue
=============================================

Overview:
---------
This example demonstrates how to track activation times during a 
2D cardiac tissue simulation using the ActivationTime2DTracker 
class in Finitewave. Activation time tracking helps analyze the propagation 
of electrical waves and conduction delays in excitable media.

Simulation Setup:
-----------------
- Tissue Grid: A 200Ã—200 cardiac tissue domain.
- Stimulation:
  - A left-side stimulus is applied at time t = 0.
  - The excitation propagates across the tissue.
- Activation Time Tracking:
  - Threshold: 0.5 (membrane potential value used to define activation).
  - Sampling interval: Every 100 steps.
- Time and Space Resolution:
  - Temporal step (dt): 0.01
  - Spatial resolution (dr): 0.25
  - Total simulation time (t_max): 50

Execution:
----------
1. Create a 2D cardiac tissue grid.
2. Apply stimulation along the left boundary to initiate wave propagation.
3. Set up an activation time tracker:
   - The tracker records the time of first activation for each tissue element.
4. Run the Aliev-Panfilov model to simulate wave dynamics.
5. Extract and visualize the activation time map.

Application:
------------
Tracking activation times is useful for:
- Analyzing conduction velocity in cardiac tissue.
- Detecting conduction blocks or delays in pathological conditions.
- Comparing different tissue properties (e.g., isotropic vs. anisotropic).

Visualization:
--------------
The activation time map is displayed using matplotlib, with a color-coded 
representation of activation delays across the tissue.
