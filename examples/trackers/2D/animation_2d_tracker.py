Creating an Animation of Action Potential in 2D
===============================================

Overview:
---------
This example demonstrates how to use the `Animation2DTracker` to generate an 
animation of the action potential (or any other variablse you choose) in a 2D cardiac tissue simulation. 
The animation is saved as a sequence of frames and can be exported as a video or GIF.

Simulation Setup:
-----------------
- Tissue Grid: A 200Ã—200 cardiac tissue domain.
- Stimulation:
  - First stimulus is applied to the bottom half of the domain at t = 0.
  - Second stimulus is applied to the left half at t = 31 to initiate wave break and spiral formation.
- Time and Space Resolution:
  - Temporal step (dt): 0.01
  - Spatial resolution (dr): 0.25
  - Total simulation time (t_max): 100

Animation Tracker:
------------------
- Tracks the transmembrane potential `u` during the simulation.
- Records a frame every 10 steps (`step = 10`).
- Frames are saved into the `anim_data/` directory.
- Existing data in the directory will be overwritten.
- After the simulation, `write()` is called to render the animation:
  - `shape_scale`: Zoom factor for each frame.
  - `clear=True`: Deletes all raw frame data after animation is generated.
  - `fps=30`: Frames per second for the output video.

Execution:
----------
1. Set up cardiac tissue and stimulation sequence.
2. Attach `Animation2DTracker` to the tracker sequence.
3. Run the Aliev-Panfilov model with configured simulation and tracking.
4. Call `write()` to generate and optionally clean up the animation.

Application:
------------
- Useful for visualizing wave propagation and reentry.
- Can be used in presentations, publications, or model comparisons.
- Helps in debugging wave dynamics and understanding tissue behavior.

Output:
-------
The animation is written to disk in the specified folder (`anim_data`). 
It shows the evolution of the transmembrane potential over time in the tissue.
