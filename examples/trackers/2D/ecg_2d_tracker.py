Electrocardiogram (ECG) Tracking in 2D Cardiac Tissue
=====================================================

Overview:
---------
This example demonstrates how to use the ECG2DTracker to record an 
electrocardiogram (ECG) from a 2D cardiac tissue simulation. The ECG 
signal is obtained from multiple measurement points at a given distance 
from the tissue.

Simulation Setup:
-----------------
- Tissue Grid: A 400Ã—400 cardiac tissue domain.
- Stimulation:
  - A left-side stimulus is applied at time t = 0.
  - The excitation wave propagates across the tissue.
- ECG Tracking:
  - Three measurement points are positioned at increasing vertical distances.
  - The signal strength is computed using an inverse distance power law.
  - Measurement points:  
    - (n/2, n/4, 10)
    - (n/2, n/2, 10)
    - (n/2, 3n/4, 10)
  - Sampling step: Every 10 time steps.
- Time and Space Resolution:
  - Temporal step (dt): 0.001
  - Spatial resolution (dr): 0.1
  - Total simulation time (t_max): 50

Execution:
----------
1. Create a 2D cardiac tissue grid.
2. Apply stimulation along the left boundary.
3. Set up an ECG tracker:
   - Records electrical activity from multiple measurement points.
   - Uses an inverse distance weighting (power = 2) to compute the 
     potential at each location.
4. Run the Aliev-Panfilov model to simulate cardiac wave propagation.
5. Extract and visualize the ECG waveform.

Application:
------------
ECG tracking in a simulated tissue is useful for:
- Studying ECG signal characteristics in controlled environments.
- Understanding the relationship between wave propagation and ECG morphology.
- Testing the effect of different tissue properties on the ECG signal.

Visualization:
--------------
The recorded ECG signal is plotted over time using matplotlib, 
illustrating how electrical wave activity in cardiac tissue translates 
into an observable ECG trace.
