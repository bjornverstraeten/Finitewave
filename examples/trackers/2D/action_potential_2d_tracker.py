Tracking Action Potentials in 2D Cardiac Tissue
===============================================

Overview:
---------
This example demonstrates how to track action potentials at specific 
cell locations in a 2D cardiac tissue simulation using the 
ActionPotential2DTracker class in Finitewave. Action potential tracking 
is crucial for analyzing electrophysiological responses at different 
tissue points.

Simulation Setup:
-----------------
- Tissue Grid: A 100Ã—100 cardiac tissue domain.
- Stimulation:
  - A left-side stimulus is applied at time t = 0.
  - The excitation wave propagates across the tissue.
- Action Potential Tracking:
  - Action potentials are recorded at two specific cells:  
    - Cell at (30, 30)
    - Cell at (70, 70)
  - Sampling step: Every time step (1 ms).
- Time and Space Resolution:
  - Temporal step (dt): 0.01
  - Spatial resolution (dr): 0.25
  - Total simulation time (t_max): 50

Execution:
----------
1. Create a 2D cardiac tissue grid.
2. Apply stimulation at the left boundary.
3. Set up an action potential tracker:
   - The tracker records the membrane potential over time at specified 
     cell indices.
4. Run the Aliev-Panfilov model to simulate wave propagation.
5. Extract and visualize action potential waveforms.

Application:
------------
Tracking action potentials is useful for:
- Studying cardiac excitability at different spatial locations.
- Comparing action potential durations across various tissue points.
- Analyzing arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities in excitable media.

Visualization:
--------------
The action potentials recorded at the selected cells are plotted over time 
using matplotlib. The graph shows the voltage dynamics of the 
excited regions.
