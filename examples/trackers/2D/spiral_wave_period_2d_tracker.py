Measuring Wave Period in 2D Cardiac Tissue
==========================================

Overview:
---------
This example demonstrates how to use the `Period2DTracker` to measure the 
wave period at specific locations in a 2D cardiac tissue simulation. 
This is particularly useful for analyzing repetitive wave activity, such as 
spiral waves or regular pacing, and for determining local cycle lengths.

Simulation Setup:
-----------------
- Tissue Grid: A 200Ã—200 cardiac tissue domain.
- Stimulation:
  - First stimulus applied to the bottom half of the domain at t = 0.
  - Second stimulus applied to the left half at t = 31 to initiate reentry.
- Time and Space Resolution:
  - Temporal step (dt): 0.01
  - Spatial resolution (dr): 0.25
  - Total simulation time (t_max): 300

Wave Period Tracking:
---------------------
- A list of detector positions is provided through the `cell_ind` parameter:
  - Positions: (1,1), (5,5), (7,3), (9,1), (100,100), (150,3), (100,150)
- The tracker monitors threshold crossings at each specified cell to calculate 
  the local activation period.
- Tracking starts at `start_time = 100` and is evaluated every `step = 10` steps.
- Threshold voltage for detection is set to `0.5`.

Execution:
----------
1. Create and configure a 2D cardiac tissue grid.
2. Apply sequential stimulation to induce spiral or repetitive wave activity.
3. Configure the `Period2DTracker` with desired cell indices.
4. Run the Aliev-Panfilov model and track the period at each specified location.
5. Plot the average and standard deviation of the measured periods.

Application:
------------
- Useful for analyzing cycle lengths during sustained wave activity.
- Applicable in reentry studies, tissue heterogeneity analysis, or pacing experiments.
- Helps evaluate the spatial variability of wave dynamics and rhythm regularity.

Output:
-------
The resulting plot shows the mean wave period at each detector location, 
along with error bars indicating standard deviation over time.
