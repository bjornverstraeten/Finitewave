Aliev-Panfilov 2D Model (Anisotropic)
=====================================

Overview:
---------
This example demonstrates how to simulate the Aliev-Panfilov model in a 
two-dimensional anisotropic cardiac tissue. Unlike the isotropic case, 
anisotropy is introduced by specifying a fiber orientation array, which 
modifies the diffusion properties of the tissue.

Simulation Setup:
-----------------
- Tissue Grid: A 400Ã—400 cardiac tissue domain is created.
- Anisotropic Diffusion: Fiber orientation is set using a direction field.
- Fiber Orientation: Defined by an angle alpha = 0.25 * pi.
- Stimulation: A localized stimulus is applied at the center of the domain.
- Time and Space Resolution:
  - Temporal step (dt): 0.01 
  - Spatial resolution (dr): 0.25 
  - Total simulation time (t_max): 30 

Execution:
----------
1. Create a 2D cardiac tissue grid with fiber orientation.
2. Define and apply a stimulus at the center.
3. Set up and initialize the Aliev-Panfilov model.
4. Run the simulation to compute wave propagation in an anisotropic medium.
5. Visualize the membrane potential distribution at the final timestep.

Anisotropic Diffusion:
----------------------
Anisotropy is implemented by defining a fiber orientation field for the 
CardiacTissue object. The model automatically selects the appropriate stencil 
to calculate the diffusion term based on fiber direction.

Visualization:
--------------
The final membrane potential distribution is displayed using matplotlib, 
showing how the excitation wave propagates in the anisotropic medium.
