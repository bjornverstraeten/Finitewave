StateKeeper Example: Saving and Loading Simulation States
=========================================================

Overview:
---------
This example demonstrates how to use the StateKeeper functionality in 
Finitewave to save and restore the state of a 2D cardiac simulation. 
This allows a simulation to be paused and resumed at a later time 
without restarting from the beginning.

Key Features:
-------------
- State Saving: The model saves intermediate states at specific times.
- State Loading: The simulation is resumed from a saved state.
- Multiple Runs: The model is executed in three phases:
  1. First run (0 - 20): The initial simulation run.
  2. Second run (10 - 20): Resumes from a saved state at t = 10.
  3. Third run (20 - 30): Resumes from a saved state at t = 20.

Simulation Setup:
-----------------
- Tissue Grid: A 400Ã—400 cardiac tissue domain.
- Stimulation: A small localized stimulus applied at the center.
- State Saving:
  - The state is saved at t = 10 ("state_0").
  - The final state is saved at t = 20 ("state_1").
- Time and Space Resolution:
  - Temporal step (dt): 0.01
  - Spatial resolution (dr): 0.25
  - First run duration: 0 - 20
  - Second and third run durations: 10 - 20 each.

Execution Workflow:
-------------------
1. Run the first simulation and save the state at t = 10 and t = 20.
2. Delete the model instance and clear memory using `gc.collect()`.
3. Create a new model instance and load "state_0", then continue the 
   simulation from t = 10 to 20.
4. Create another new instance, load "state_1", and run from t = 20 to 30.
5. Visualize the results:
   - First run (t=0 to 20)
   - Second run (t=10 to 20)
   - Third run (t=20 to 30)
6. Delete saved states to clean up temporary files.

Application:
------------
State saving is useful for:
- Long simulations: Avoids restarting from scratch in case of interruptions.
- Parameter tuning: Allows resuming simulations from intermediate states.
- Multi-stage analysis: Investigates different scenarios from a common starting point.

Visualization:
--------------
The final results are displayed using matplotlib, showing the progression of 
the simulation across the three phases.
